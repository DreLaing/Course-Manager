## Description

#### Problem
When joining Adtelligent, there are a set of required courses for
each new team member based on their department. However, these
courses are located on sites all over the internet, on E-Learning
websites ( e.g. Codecademy ), and other platforms such as Youtube.Because of this, it can be an issue to locate the right course just by
name for the new team members. Also, they canâ€™t benefit from
knowing what they will learn, because there is no central location for
comments on the course.

#### Solution
The company has decided to build its own course management system to provide their team members with a central place to find these courses, specific to their department. This project is a prototype of the proposed solution, and therefore does not have all the features of the final product.

#### Technologies

- ReactJS
- NodeJS (ExpressJS)
- MongoDB
- MDBootstrap

### Requirements
- The users must be able to log in using their email address.

- The user must be able to leave comments and a new rating
on the course.

- The user must be able to click an external link to the course.

- The user should be able to search for courses by the key skills
taught in the course and the course name.

- The user should be able to mark a course as finished, with
details on how long the course duration was.

- The administrator should be able to manually add more
departments and courses.

- The system must have API access to the list of courses for all
CRUD operations.

## Design Decisions
- Only the Administrator is able to create a new user. This is to prevent persons from accessing the application without being an Adtelligent employee.
- Administrators and employees login through the same portal. Ideally, the admin section should be completely separated from other users. However, for simplicity, I decided to have one login portal and to protect different API routes by using different JSON web tokens for authentication.


## Limitations
- Currently, the administrator is unable to edit department information.
- Not responsive on all devices.
